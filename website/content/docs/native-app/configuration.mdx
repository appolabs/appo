## App Configuration

App configuration is managed through the [Appo dashboard](https://goappo.io). Settings you configure in the dashboard are applied to the native app during the build process.

### Basic Settings

- **App name** — Display name on the home screen and stores (max 255 characters)
- **App icon** — Upload a custom image (PNG, JPEG, or WebP, max 5MB). If not provided, Appo generates one from your website.
- **Base URL** — The website URL loaded in the WebView

### Auto-Generated Settings

These are created by Appo and cannot be changed manually:

- **iOS Bundle ID** — Generated as `com.appo.{app-slug}`
- **Android Package Name** — Generated as `com.appo.{app-slug}`
- **URL Scheme** — Custom scheme for deep links (e.g., `myapp://`)

## Permissions

Each SDK feature requires platform-specific permissions. Appo configures the necessary permissions based on the features your app uses.

### Configurable Permissions

The following permissions can be toggled in the dashboard with custom usage descriptions:

| Permission | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Tracking | App Tracking Transparency (iOS). Required if your web app uses analytics or advertising that tracks users across apps. |
| Camera | Camera access for photo capture |
| Microphone | Microphone access for audio recording |

### Automatic Permissions

The remaining permissions are configured automatically by the build system based on the SDK features your app uses:

**iOS:**

| SDK Feature | Permission | Configured |
|-------------|-----------|------------|
| Push Notifications | Notification permission | Automatic |
| Location (foreground) | Location when in use | Automatic |
| Location (background) | Location always | Automatic |
| Biometrics | Face ID | Automatic |

**Android:**

| SDK Feature | Android Permission | Configured |
|-------------|-------------------|------------|
| Push Notifications | `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED`, `VIBRATE` | Automatic |
| Location (fine) | `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` | Automatic |
| Location (coarse) | `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` | Automatic |
| Network Status | `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` | Automatic |
| Biometrics | `USE_BIOMETRIC`, `USE_FINGERPRINT` | Automatic |
| Vibration (haptics) | `VIBRATE` | Automatic |

## Universal Links and Deep Links

Deep links allow external URLs to open directly in your app. The Appo dashboard includes a setup wizard to guide you through configuration.

### Universal Links (iOS)

For HTTPS URLs (e.g., `https://myapp.com/invite/abc`) to open in your app, you need to host an `apple-app-site-association` file at:

```
https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/apple-app-site-association
```

The dashboard wizard provides the exact file contents and walks you through the setup.

### App Links (Android)

For Android, host an `assetlinks.json` file at:

```
https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/assetlinks.json
```

The dashboard wizard provides the correct file contents for your app.

## WebView Configuration

The WebView loads your web application and handles the bridge communication. Default settings:

- **User Agent** — Includes `AppoNative` for SDK environment detection
- **JavaScript** — Always enabled (required for the bridge)
- **DOM Storage** — Enabled for localStorage fallback in the SDK storage module
- **Back/forward navigation gestures** — Enabled by default
- **Scroll bounce** — Disabled by default

These defaults work for most applications. Contact support if you need custom WebView configuration.
