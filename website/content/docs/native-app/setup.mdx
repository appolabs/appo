## Creating Your App

Appo creates your native app from your website URL. You provide the URL — Appo generates the app name, icon, and all native configuration automatically.

### From the Dashboard

**New users:**

1. Go to [goappo.io/new](https://goappo.io/new).
2. Enter your **name**, **email**, and **password** to create an account.
3. Enter your **website URL** — the web application that will run inside the native app.
4. Appo fetches your website metadata and generates the app name and icon automatically.
5. Review and edit the app name or upload a custom icon if needed.

**Existing users:**

1. Sign in at [goappo.io](https://goappo.io).
2. Enter your **website URL** to create a new app.
3. Appo generates the app name and icon from your website.

After creation, your app status is **Pending** while Appo prepares the native build. Once ready, you can preview it on your device and publish to the stores.

### From a Plugin

Appo integrates with platforms like Shopify. When using a plugin:

1. Install the Appo plugin from your platform's marketplace.
2. Connect your Appo account.
3. The plugin configures the app automatically from your existing store or site settings.

More platform plugins will be available in the future.

## What You Can Edit

After creation, you can update these settings from the dashboard:

- **App name** — The display name on the home screen and stores
- **App icon** — Upload a custom PNG, JPEG, or WebP image (max 5MB)
- **Base URL** — The website URL loaded in the native app
- **Custom CSS** — Inject CSS into the WebView
- **Custom JavaScript** — Inject JavaScript into the WebView

## SDK Integration

For the native bridge to work, your website needs the Appo SDK installed. See [Installation](/getting-started/installation) for setup instructions.

Once the SDK is loaded, your web app can call native features like `appo.push.requestPermission()`. These calls are bridged to the native layer automatically — no additional configuration is needed on the native side.

## What Appo Manages

Appo handles the native side entirely:

- **Native app wrapper** — The app that hosts your WebView
- **Feature handlers** — Native implementations for push notifications, biometrics, camera, and all other SDK features
- **Event broadcasting** — Push notification and network change events forwarded to your web app
- **Bundle IDs** — iOS bundle ID and Android package name generated automatically
- **Build pipeline** — Cloud builds for iOS and Android
- **Store submission** — Publishing to the App Store and Play Store

You focus on your web application. Appo handles the rest.
