Before publishing, preview your app on real devices to verify that native features work correctly.

## Previewing Your App

The Appo dashboard provides a preview mechanism to test your app on your device:

- **Desktop** — A QR code is displayed on the dashboard. Scan it with your phone to open the preview.
- **Mobile** — A direct link opens the preview app on your device.

The preview loads your website inside the native wrapper with the bridge active, so you can test all SDK features.

## Testing the WebView Integration

After opening the preview, verify the bridge communication and native features.

### Bridge communication

1. Open the app and confirm your web application loads inside the WebView
2. Verify `window.ReactNativeWebView` exists — this confirms the native bridge is injected
3. Test that `appo.isNative` returns `true`

### Native features

Test each feature API to verify the native handlers respond correctly:

- **Push notifications** — Request permission, obtain token, send a test notification and verify foreground, background, and cold-start delivery
- **Biometrics** — Trigger authentication and verify the device prompt appears
- **Camera** — Request permission and capture a photo
- **Location** — Request permission and read coordinates
- **Haptics** — Trigger impact and notification feedback
- **Storage** — Write and read a value to confirm native secure storage
- **Share** — Open the native share sheet with test content
- **Network** — Check connection status and toggle airplane mode to verify change events
- **Device** — Read device info and confirm values match the physical device

### Push notification flow

Push notifications require extra attention because they involve multiple delivery paths:

1. **Foreground** — App is open; notification received via `push.onMessage` event
2. **Background** — App is backgrounded; system notification appears, tapping it opens the app
3. **Cold start** — App is terminated; tapping the notification launches the app with the notification payload

Verify all three paths deliver the expected data to your web application.

## Common Issues

### WebView not loading

- Confirm the base URL in your dashboard points to your web application
- Check that the web server is running and accessible from the device's network
- Ensure the URL is reachable from the device (not `localhost` unless using a tunnel)

### Bridge not connecting

- Verify `window.ReactNativeWebView` is defined in the WebView context
- Check that the web application loads inside the native wrapper, not in a standalone browser
- Review the console for bridge initialization errors

### Push tokens not received

- Confirm notification permissions are granted in the device Settings app
- On iOS, push notifications require a physical device — simulators cannot receive tokens
- Verify push notification configuration is enabled in the Appo dashboard
