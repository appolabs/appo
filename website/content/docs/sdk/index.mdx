description: The Appo JavaScript bridge SDK for accessing native device features from web applications.
---

The `@appolabs/appo` SDK provides a unified JavaScript API for accessing native device capabilities from web applications running inside React Native WebViews.

## What the SDK Provides

- **9 feature APIs** — Push notifications, biometrics, camera, location, haptics, storage, share, network, and device information
- **Bridge protocol** — Request/response communication with the native layer via `postMessage`
- **Event system** — Subscribe to native events (push messages, network changes)
- **Browser fallbacks** — All APIs return sensible defaults outside a native container
- **Type safety** — Full TypeScript with exported interfaces

## Guides

- [Architecture](/docs/sdk/architecture) — Bridge protocol, message correlation, and event channels
- [Error Handling](/docs/sdk/error-handling) — Structured errors with categorized codes
- [Logging](/docs/sdk/logging) — Observe bridge activity with `setLogger`
- [Browser Fallbacks](/docs/sdk/browser-fallbacks) — Fallback behavior for every API
