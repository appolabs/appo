description: Observe bridge activity with the setLogger callback.
---

The SDK produces no console output by default. Use `setLogger` to observe bridge activity.

## Setup

```typescript
import { setLogger } from '@appolabs/appo';

setLogger((level, message, data) => {
  // level: 'debug' | 'warn' | 'error'
  console.log(`[appo:${level}]`, message, data);
});
```

## Disable Logging

```typescript
setLogger(null);
```

## Log Events

| Level | Event | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| `debug` | Sending message | A bridge message is being sent to the native layer |
| `debug` | Received response | A response was received for a pending request |
| `debug` | Received event | An event broadcast was received from the native layer |
| `warn` | Request timed out | The native layer did not respond within the timeout |
| `warn` | Failed to parse message | An incoming message could not be parsed as JSON |
| `warn` | Invalid message structure | A message was received that is neither a response nor an event |

Payloads are excluded from log data to prevent leaking sensitive information. The `data` parameter contains metadata like message IDs and types.
